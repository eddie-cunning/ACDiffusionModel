# ACDiffusionModel
Monte-Carlo Moddeling of fluid and fibres with the articular cartilage (AC).
By Eddie Cunning, student at QUT

These functions model diffusion in the transitional zone in three different ways

The Basic funtion locks each fibre into a set angle relative tot he x-y plane
The Random function randomly assigned these angles
The Semi Random function randomly assigned the angles, and if thers is an intersection between the fibrs, it again randomly assigned the angle untill there is no intersection

The saved variables in the functions can be altered.
Only the live scripts have grpahing for all of the pariticles
